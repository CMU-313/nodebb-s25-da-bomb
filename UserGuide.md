User Guide for Search Replies by Keyword Feature

Introduction
This adds a placeholder search bar to discussion topics so that we can search 
replies by keyword. It's placed in the same location as search bars on other pages 
for consistency.

How to Use the Feature
Currently, this is only the front-end design so the search functionality cannot be 
tested.

Link/Description
The file path is nodebb-theme-harmony/templates/topic.tpl and lines 29 - 36 create 
and format the search bar.
