UserGuide.md:

In test/goodQuestion.js, you are able to run a test that checks that, when clicking the Green Check-Mark next to the upvote
button on any particular post, it is marked as a "Good Question" by NodeBB. This test is sufficient for covering the change I made
as this is the only feature implemented; I did not work on "un-voting" or any other feature.
