To use this feature, navigate to a topic and select "Topic Tools."

The automated tests for this can be found in test/answered.js. The tests create and categorize topics as answered and unanswered, and assure that they are valid topics. This is sufficient for the features I implemented, as there are no feature to interact with these new categories yet.
